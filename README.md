AGS Configurations

Personal AGS Configurations

This repository contains my customized configurations for AGS, a dynamic layout system for Hyprland. These configurations are a refined and more functional adaptation of end-4's Hyprland dots.
ðŸ”‘ Key Features

    Minimalist Design: A clean and streamlined setup for a distraction-free workflow.
    Enhanced Functionality: Adds custom modules and configurations tailored for improved usability.
    Seamless Integration: Works best with my personal dotfiles.
